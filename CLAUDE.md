# üõ°Ô∏è PakoMarket - Claude Code Instructions

This file contains specific instructions for Claude Code when working on the PakoMarket prediction market platform.

## Project Overview
PakoMarket is a crypto-native prediction market platform for Africa built as a TypeScript monorepo targeting Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Architecture & Structure
- **Monorepo**: `/apps/web` (Next.js), `/packages/sdk` (TypeScript), `/contracts` (Solidity/Foundry), `/docs`
- **Target Network**: Polygon Amoy testnet (Chain ID: 80002)
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, viem/wagmi, Foundry, OpenZeppelin

## üîí Security-First Development Rules

### Golden Principles
- **ALWAYS** prioritize security in all design and code decisions
- **NEVER** commit secrets, private keys, or sensitive information
- Prefer clarity and maintainability over micro-optimizations
- Keep modules small and self-explanatory (max 200 lines for components, 600 for contracts)

### Environment & Configuration
- Use `.env.local` for secrets; validate with zod schemas on startup
- Load contract addresses from centralized config (`lib/config.ts`, `sdk/addresses.ts`)
- **NEVER** hardcode addresses or keys in components
- Only expose client-safe variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

### Smart Contracts (`/contracts/src/`)
- **MUST** use OpenZeppelin security primitives (`AccessControl`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `Pausable`)
- Enforce state machine: `Open ‚Üí PendingResolution ‚Üí DisputeWindow ‚Üí Resolved | Invalid`
- Implement minimum stake ($1 USDC), slippage protection, and deadline checks
- Use multisig (2-of-3) for `RESOLVER_ROLE` and `PAUSER_ROLE`
- Store IPFS CIDs for resolution evidence on-chain
- **NEVER** allow trades after market close time
- **NEVER** use upgradeable proxies in MVP (versioned deployments only)

### SDK Development (`/packages/sdk/`)
- Expose typed hooks: `useMarkets`, `useTrade`, `useCashout`, `useResolve`
- Enforce slippage protection and deadline checks on every trade
- Reject transactions with mismatched chainId
- Document all exports with comprehensive JSDoc
- **NEVER** bypass input validation

### Frontend (`/apps/web/`)
- Mobile-first, responsive design using Tailwind CSS finance theme
- Use established UI patterns (Radix UI components)
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- **NEVER** expose private keys or sensitive data to browser

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

### Root Level
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start web app development server
pnpm build        # Build web app
pnpm test         # Run contract tests
pnpm lint         # Lint all packages
pnpm typecheck    # Type check all packages
```

### Contracts (`/contracts/`)
```bash
forge build      # Compile contracts
forge test        # Run tests
forge test -vvv   # Run tests with verbose output
```

### Web App (`/apps/web/`)
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm typecheck    # Type check
```

## üéØ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Smart contracts with CPMM implementation
- Frontend UI with mock data
- Project structure and tooling
- Security-focused architecture

### üîÑ In Progress / Pending
- SDK hook implementations (currently placeholders)
- Contract deployment to Polygon Amoy
- Web3 wallet integration
- IPFS metadata handling
- Multisig setup for governance roles

## üìù Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. **Always** start by reading existing code patterns
2. Follow the established architecture (UI ‚Üí SDK ‚Üí Contracts)
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add TypeScript types for all new interfaces
5. Write tests for contract changes
6. Update this documentation if adding new commands or patterns

### Code Style
- Use existing libraries (Radix UI, Tailwind utilities)
- Follow established naming conventions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions pure and testable
- Use descriptive variable names

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses or secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Slippage protection on trades
- [ ] Deadline checks on time-sensitive operations
- [ ] Access control on administrative functions
- [ ] Reentrancy protection on state changes

## üö® Never Do
- Commit API keys, private keys, or secrets
- Bypass input validation or security checks
- Use upgradeable contracts in production
- Allow trades after market close time
- Hardcode contract addresses in components
- Create "god files" with excessive complexity

## üìö Key Files to Reference
- `.cursorrules` - Complete development rules
- `contracts/src/Market.sol` - Core market logic
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Main UI patterns
- `packages/sdk/src/hooks/` - SDK hook structure
- `apps/web/.env.local` - Environment configuration

Remember: **Security comes first**, followed by clean, maintainable code.
