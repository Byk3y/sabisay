## Overview
Successfully implemented complete admin event lifecycle management including Edit, Archive, and Resolve features.

---

## ✅ All Features Implemented

### 1. Database Migration
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Applied via Supabase MCP with the following fields added to `events` table:
- `archived_at` - Timestamp when archived
- `previous_status` - Status before archiving (for potential unarchive)
- `resolved_at` - Timestamp when resolved
- `winning_outcome_idx` - Index of winning outcome
- `evidence_url` - URL to resolution evidence
- `evidence_cid` - IPFS CID for evidence
- `resolution_notes` - Admin notes on resolution
- `image_url` - Cover image URL
- `description` - Event description

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_events_archived_at`
- `idx_events_resolved_at`
- `idx_events_status`

---

### 2. TypeScript Types
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**File:** `apps/web/src/types/admin.ts`

**Updates:**
- Expanded `EventStatus` to include `'archived'` and `'resolved'`

**Updates:**

- Resolve action for closed events (opens modal)
- Archive action for non-archived events

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Slug Stability ✅
- Slug NEVER changes after creation
- Title preserved for SEO
- Question changes (draft only) don't affect slug
- Read-only display in edit UI

### 2. Progressive Restrictions ✅
```
draft      → Can edit: everything
live       → Can edit: rules, image, extend close time
closed     → Can edit: rules, image, extend close time
resolved   → Cannot edit (redirect)
archived   → Cannot edit (redirect)
```

### 3. Status Transitions ✅
```
draft → live → closed → resolved
   ↓      ↓       ↓        ↓
              archived (from any)
```

### 4. Blockchain Integration (Future)
- Resolution is **stubbed** for v1
- Database-only implementation
- Clear TODO comments for v2
- Warning in UI about stub status

---

## Security & Validation

✅ **Authentication:**
- Admin auth on all routes
- Session validation
- `is_admin` flag check

✅ **CSRF Protection:**
- All mutations protected
- Token validation

✅ **Input Validation:**
- Zod schemas for all endpoints
- Client-side validation
- Server-side enforcement

✅ **Status-Based Access:**
- Edit restrictions by status
- Action visibility based on status
- Transition validation

✅ **Data Integrity:**
- Atomic updates
- Proper error handling
- Rollback on failures

## Known Limitations (v1)

1. **Resolution is database-only**
   - No blockchain interaction
   - No payouts triggered
   - No dispute mechanism
   - Clearly marked in UI and code

2. **No unarchive feature**
   - Previous status saved for future implementation
   - Would require UI and endpoint

3. **Export is stubbed**
   - Bulk export shows "coming soon"
   - Would need CSV generation

4. **No edit history/audit log**
   - Changes are not tracked
   - Future enhancement

5. **No batch resolve**
   - Only single event resolution
   - Future enhancement
