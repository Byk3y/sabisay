# Admin Event Management v1 - Implementation Summary

## Completed: Steps 1-4 (Edit Feature)

### Step 1: Database Migration ✅

**Applied Migration:** `add_admin_event_management_fields`

**New Fields Added to `events` table:**
- `archived_at` - TIMESTAMPTZ NULL (timestamp when archived)
- `previous_status` - TEXT NULL (status before archiving)
- `resolved_at` - TIMESTAMPTZ NULL (timestamp when resolved)
- `winning_outcome_idx` - INTEGER NULL (winning outcome index)
- `evidence_url` - TEXT NULL (resolution evidence URL)
- `evidence_cid` - TEXT NULL (IPFS CID for evidence)
- `resolution_notes` - TEXT NULL (admin notes on resolution)
- `image_url` - TEXT NULL (cover image URL)
- `description` - TEXT NULL (event description)

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_events_archived_at` - For filtering archived events
- `idx_events_resolved_at` - For filtering resolved events
- `idx_events_status` - For status-based queries

---

### Step 2: Type Updates ✅

**File:** `apps/web/src/types/admin.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Expanded `EventStatus` type to include:
   - `'archived'` - Events that have been archived
   - `'resolved'` - Events that have been resolved

2. Created new `EventOutcome` interface:
   ```typescript
   interface EventOutcome {
     id: string;
     event_id: string;
     label: string;
     idx: number;
     color?: string | null;
     created_at: string;
   }
   ```

3. Created comprehensive `EventDetail` interface:
   - Extends `EventListItem`
   - Includes full event data with outcomes
   - Includes all new resolution and archive fields

4. Updated `EventAction` to support new actions: `'archive'` and `'resolve'`

---

### Step 3: API Endpoints ✅

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/events/[id]/route.ts`

#### GET /api/admin/events/[id]
**Purpose:** Fetch single event with all details for editing

**Features:**
- Admin authentication check
- Fetches event with related outcomes
- Sorts outcomes by index
- Returns 404 if event not found
- Returns comprehensive `EventDetail` object

#### PUT /api/admin/events/[id]
**Purpose:** Update event and outcomes

**Validation Rules:**
- ✅ Cannot edit resolved or archived events
- ✅ Cannot change question after publish (live/closed status)
- ✅ Cannot change event type after creation
- ✅ Close time must be in future
- ✅ Live events: can only extend close time, not shorten
- ✅ Binary markets: must have exactly 2 outcomes
- ✅ Multi markets: must have 2-8 outcomes

**Features:**
- CSRF protection
- Zod schema validation
- Atomic updates with error handling
- Smart outcome handling:
  - Updates existing outcomes by ID
  - Inserts new outcomes
  - Deletes removed outcomes
- Slug and title are NEVER regenerated (preserves URLs)

---

### Step 4: Edit UI ✅

**Files Created:**
1. `apps/web/src/app/admin/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
2. `apps/web/src/app/admin/events/[id]/edit/EditEventForm.tsx`

#### Edit Page Features:

**Server Component (`page.tsx`):**
- Admin authentication guard
- Pre-fetches event data from database
- Redirects if event not found
- Redirects if event is resolved/archived
- Passes event data to client form

**Client Form (`EditEventForm.tsx`):**

**Smart Field Locking:**
- Draft/Pending: Can edit everything
- Live/Closed: Can only edit rules, image, and extend close time
- Resolved/Archived: Redirected (cannot edit)

**UI Features:**
- Warning banner for limited editing on live events
- Read-only slug display with link to public page
- Pre-populated form fields from event data
- Disabled fields based on status
- Real-time validation feedback
- Two-panel composer layout (matches create form)

**Validation:**
- Question: 10-500 characters
- Outcomes: 2-8, all must have labels
- Close time: Must be future, cannot shorten for live events
- Rules: 10-2000 characters
- Live validation with error display

**Components Reused:**
- `ModernSectionCard` - Collapsible sections
- `ModernInput` - Text inputs and textareas
- `MarketTypeSelector` - Type display (disabled)
- `ModernOutcomesEditor` - Outcome editing with color picker
- `ImageUpload` - Cover image upload
- `ModernButton` - Action buttons

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Slug Stability
- ✅ Slug is NEVER regenerated after creation
- ✅ Question changes (only in draft) don't affect slug
- ✅ Title is preserved for SEO
- ✅ Read-only display in edit form

### 2. Progressive Restrictions
- Draft → Can edit everything
- Live → Limited to rules, image, extending close time
- Closed → Same as live
- Resolved/Archived → Cannot edit

### 3. Data Integrity
- Atomic updates (event + outcomes in transaction)
- Proper error handling with rollback
- Status validation before mutations
- Type safety with Zod schemas

### 4. User Experience
- Clear warnings for limited editing
- Disabled fields with explanations
- Real-time validation feedback
- Link to view public page
- Consistent with create form UX

## Security Features

✅ Admin authentication on all routes  
✅ CSRF protection on mutations  
✅ Input validation via Zod schemas  
✅ Status-based access control  
✅ Server-side data fetching  
✅ Type-safe database operations

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

**Step 5-7 will include:**
- Archive API endpoint (`POST /api/admin/events/[id]/archive`)
- Resolve API endpoint (`POST /api/admin/events/[id]/resolve`)
- UI updates to event list for new actions

## Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Events table now has:
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN previous_status TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN winning_outcome_idx INTEGER NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN evidence_url TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN evidence_cid TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN resolution_notes TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN image_url TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN description TEXT NULL;

-- Indexes added:
CREATE INDEX idx_events_archived_at ON events(archived_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_resolved_at ON events(resolved_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_status ON events(status);
```
